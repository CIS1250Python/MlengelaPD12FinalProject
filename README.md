# The Final Project
In this final project, I applied skills taught throughout the course to create a program of my own design. The instructor provides some sources (see below) to get some project ideas. 
# The Program: 
1. The program must incorporate the following:
   * Use the loops and conditionals (while loops and if/else, for example)
   * Use of exception handling when getting user input, where applicable.
   * Ability to save and retrieve data using either through a GUI, the console, or other method.
   * Ability to display information, either a GUI, a console, or other method.
   * Exhibit a reasonable level of complexity. It should be comparable to the last few programming assignments you have completed. Don't select too difficult a project!
   * Should, if possible, be related to your degree major.
   * For any project ideas you're unsure about, send me a message, and we can talk about it. 
3. IMPORTANT: If you use the other sources(such as online tutorials) to create your program, you must reference, in your comments, what you used. Include the name of the organization/person
   who authored the tutorial and provide a URL to the website or a reference to the book used. Your project should involve some modifications to this work and state what modifications you made.
